# Starting your Django app

Before we start, it is very useful to know that one Django project can have one or more applications (or apps). For example, if we create a Django project for a library, we can have a app called catalog, for the books; other app called HR, to manage the employees; another app called warehouse, for all the physical goods stored, such as chair, tables, and so on. 

For our first Django app, we will create a project with only one app. However, keep in mind that you can create as many apps as you need for your project. 

## Some basic commands used on the terminal:

- cd foldername
- python manage.py startapp appname
- python manage.py runserver
- python manage.py migrate
- python manage.py makemigrations

You always can come back here, if you forget them.

## Django **startapp** command

As mentioned previewsly, a Django project can have more than one app. To create a app you need to create a folder with a particular structure by run the command bellow:

```
python manage.py startapp <appnamehere>
```

## Django **runserver** command

Everytime you want to run your Django application on your localhost you will need to run the command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```


## Django **migrations** command

Every time we change something on our Django's app, weneed to migrate. Migrations are Djangoâ€™s way of propagating changes you make to our models, for example, to add a field, deleting a model, and soon. It is the only way the changes will be applied to our database schema. The command to Migrate your Django changes is: 

```
python manage.py migrate command
```

## Django **makemigrations** command

Afeter you run the migrations, you need to make the migrations accessible by using the command:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
```

It will make all the changes ...




Django framework have a very specific folder structure. We will learn about it as we create our Django app.
