# Creating a new project

```
Creating the project
```
Open a command shell (or a terminal window), and make sure you are in your virtual environment.
Navigate to where you want to store your Django apps (make it somewhere easy to find like inside your Documents folder), and create a folder for your new website (in this case: django_projects).Then change into your newly-created directory:

```
mkdir django_projects
cd django_projects
```

# Creating your first app

Now that we have created a Django project environment, let's create our app. As previewsly mentioned, one project can have many apps. But for the purpose of this course we will create just one app.
