# Web development

The term ```front-end``` refers to the user interface, while ```back-end``` means the server, application and database that work behind the scenes to deliver information to the user. To becoming a ```full-stack``` developer can be challenging and requires constant learning. You will need to know a backend framework, such as Django and a front-end framework, such as HTML.

# Front-end Development

The front-end is built using a combination of technologies such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JQuery, and Bootstrap. Front-end developers design and construct the user experience elements on the web pages or web apps including buttons, menus, pages, links, graphics and more.

HTML is the core of a website, providing the overall design and functionality. The updated version includes more tools aimed at web application developers as well as adjustments made to improve interoperability.

CSS give developers a flexible, precise way to create attractive, interactive website designs.

JavaScript is an event-based language is useful for creating dynamic elements on static HTML web pages. It allows developers to access elements separate from the main HTML page, as well as respond to server-side events.

# Back-end Development

The back-end, also called the server side, consists of the server which provides data on request, the application which channels it, and the database which organizes the information. For example, when a customer browses shoes on a website, they are interacting with the front end. After they select the item they want, put it in the shopping cart, and authorize the purchase, the information is kept inside the database which resides on the server. A few days later when the client checks on the status of their delivery, the server pulls the relevant information, updates it with tracking data, and presents it through the front-end.

The core concern of back-end developers is creating applications that can find and deliver data to the front end. There’s also a number of other popular databases including MySQL, and PostgreSQL. There are a wide variety of frameworks and languages used to code the application, such as Java, PHP, and Python.

# Full-stack Development

A full-stack developer is a very profitable job. The development of both the back- and front-end systems has become so specialized, it’s most common for a developer to specialize in only one. As a general rule, full-stack development by a single programmer isn’t a practical solution. However, at times a custom software development company will have developers who are proficient with both sides, known as a full-stack developer.

The best way to create the perfect front-end and back-end combination is to outline the specific project at hands requirements and assemble the stack that fits those.
